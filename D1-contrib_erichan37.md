Feedback:
What went well:
Working with my partner worked very well, we were comfortable in sharing the work 
and work very well
What went poorly:
Time management and how much time d1 took.  D1 took forever and we pulled an all nighter
for what progress we have now.
Approach:
Starting earlier, we're starting waaaaaay earlier.
